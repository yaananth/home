Welcome!
========

Welcome to ExtendedXMLSerializer's GitHub repository.  Here you will find a .NET serializer that:

- Specializes in [POCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object)-based object graph serialization
- Features a powerful extension model
- Operates in the tried-and-trusted dependable XML format. 游눘

"But why?"
==========

The classic `System.Xml.XmlSerializer` poses some challenges:

- Does not support properties that are defined with interface types
- Does not support read-only collection properties (like Xaml does)
- Does not support parameterized constructors (immutable objects)
- Does not support private constructors
- Does not support serialization of class with circular reference or class with interface property
- If you want create custom serializer, your class must inherit from `IXmlSerializable` or `ISerializable`.  This takes the "plain" out of [POCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object). 游때
- No migration mechanism for XML based on older code model

ExtendedXmlSerializer addresses a lot of these problems and much much more!

- Serializes and deserializes pretty much any POCO you throw at it*: `class`, `struct`, generics, primitives, generic `List` and `Dictionary`, `Array`, `Enum` and much much more! If you find a class that doesn't get serialized, [let us know](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/issues/new) and we'll take a look at it.
- Custom serializer registration by type or member
- Serialization of references, handling circular references without endlessly looping
- All configurations (migrations, custom serializer...) are outside the class and not coupled to attributes or messy, arcane conventions
- Migrate old XML based on an older schema to a current schema
- Property encryption
- Support `XmlElementAttribute`, `XmlRootAttribute`, and `XmlTypeAttribute` for identity resolution
- Additional attribute support: `XmlIgnoreAttribute`, `XmlAttributeAttribute`, and `XmlEnumAttribute`
- Deserialization xml from classic `XmlSerializer` (mostly, [details in FAQ](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/wiki/FAQs#systemxmlserializer-vs-extendedxmlserializer))

(\*Yes, this even -- and *especially* -- means classes with properties that have an interface property type!)

Supported platforms:

- .NET Standard 2.0
- .NET 4.5.2 ([as of #273](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/issues/273))

Usage
=====

ExtendedXmlSerializer uses a `ConfigurationContainer` to store configurations and extensions.  Once this container is configured as desired, call its `Create` method to create a serializer and serialize!

Example class:

``` csharp
class Subject {
    public int Number { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; }
}
```

Configure, create, and serialize:

``` csharp
IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().UseAutoFormatting()
                                                                .UseOptimizedNamespaces()
                                                                .EnableImplicitTyping(typeof(Subject))
                                                                // Additional configurations...
                                                                .Create();

var instance = new Subject {Message = "Hello World!", Number = 42};
var document = serializer.Serialize(new XmlWriterSettings {Indent = true},
                                    instance);
```

MAKE THE PRETTY XML!!! 游때游때游때

(contents of the `document` variable above:)

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Subject Number="42" Message="Hello World!" />
```
